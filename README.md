# Breast-Cancer-Machine-Learning
This is a repository of my work regarding the breast cancer dataset from kaggle. Using four models of classification with supervised learning. I determine the accuracy when I'm trying to figure out if a tumor is "malignant" or "benign". Going through the model I was able to find a bunch of different accuracies all around 98-99% from these four models, and used a variety of methods to check for this accuracy. This also contains my powerpoint and conference paper which will show all my work along with the code. 

These models include
1. GLM or logistic regression
2. SVM or support vector machine
3. Random Forest
4. GLMnet models

using these I found a lot of different metrics that will determine whether the model works and then at the end which is the preferred model out of the four. This was a project mostly working through how to find this categorical data and how best to analyze it thanks to these four models.
